# Sedaia Design's Portfolio

## About the project

This project is a portfolio website for Sedaia Design, a kinda brand I'm trying to build for myself for my 3D and Web-based work. The project itself is built using SolidStart, a framework by the SolidJS project which allows for easy creation of websites and web apps using SolidJS.

While the project initially used TailwindCSS for the styling framework, I recently switched to my new custom CSS framework called [Sedaia Design](https://github.com/SedaiaDesign/sedaia-design). Sedaia Design is a structured CSS framework that is designed to be straightforward to use and very customizable. Although, right now it's still in development as this site is a test-bed for the framework and is slowly building up different components and features.

## This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-cli)
